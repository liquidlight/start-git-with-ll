#Start Git with Liquid Light

This repo is here for people to clone, play and commit. 

## Beyond...

If you're feeling brave and want to practice pushing and merge requests, feel free.

Most pull requests will be merged (within reason), so give it a shot!

All I ask is that you leave the README alone.
